                  <h3>#Goal 1 (Reducing the use of Plastic)</h3>
                  <p>Plastic has been an enemy of mother nature since people started using them. 
                     As indecomposable as it is, it harms the earth in many ways. Trees and wildlife suffer the most out of the increased mass usage of plastic. 
                     So as a result, one of my goals in being a part of sustainable development is reducing the use of plastic. 
                     It is simple. Firstly, I always bring a cloth tote bag so whenever I go to supermarkets, I can refuse taking plastic bags. 
                     This will save me 10 cents as well as less usage of plastic bag. Even if a person participates, it does still reduce the global pollution. 
                     Just imagine a thousand other people who bring a tote, this could be a being effect if billions of people just save ONE plastic bag.</p>

                  <h3>#Goal 2 (Reducing the use of Water)</h3>
                  <p>Water is an important part of our lives as well as for the earth. Not only humans need water, but also plants and wildlife for daily survival.
                     However, we waste water daily while showering and so on. Saving water not only plays a role in less waste, it also helps sustainable development.
                     Personally, I would save water by closing the shower tap if I am applying soap. Moreover, I could fill the water with a cup while brushing teeth and only using the washing machine 
                     when needed and not every time.</p>

                  <h3>#Goal 3 (Reducing the use of Vehicles)</h3>
                  <p>Vehicles require petrol to travel. As the number of vehicles increases, the usage of petrol increases as well. This results in the excess drainage of crude oil in the underground.
                     This harms the earth as crude oil is a non-renewable resource; we cannot grow or make them artificially as it is often known as fossil fuels from millions of years ago.
                     This can be solved by using more public transportations rather than personal vehicles. For my part, I often take public transportations and use a bike in order to save the earth.</p>
